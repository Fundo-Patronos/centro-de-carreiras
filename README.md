# Patronos' Careers Center

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **Patronos' Careers Center**, a free open-source platform designed to help students from Unicamp (University of Campinas) connect with mentors — alumni who have already graduated — and explore opportunities offered by the fund’s partners.

## About Patronos

## Database

For storing data, we use [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/). It is a no-code data platform that enables non-technical volunteers from Patronos to visualize and manage the data. Airtable is also the responsible for the platform's e-mail automations and the embedded iframes for visualizing the available mentors and opportunities. For accessing our Airtable project, please get in contact with Patronos. 

## Infrastructure

For deploying our application, we use GCP's Cloud Run. If you need to work on the deployments, get in contact with Patronos to request access to our GCP organization.
